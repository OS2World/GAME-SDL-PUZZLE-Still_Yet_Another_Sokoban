MAIN:
-----

-	Quitting should ask you if you're sure etc.
-	Per-user settings (rather use the registry on Windows, perhaps?
	Then we get this functionality "for free". On *nix systems, we
	get it "for free" anyway.)

FRAMEWORK:
----------

-	CdjSettings should have "subsection" capability (recursive / tree structure?)
-	Fullscreen switching problems in Windows (SDL?)

SOKOBAN:
--------

-	FONT: 'R' character has some pixels coming up from next character below it
-	Make option to not "animate" man (some people may find it distracting)
-	Put 8x13 font back
-	AAARGH! RELEASE MODE CRASH IF NOT RUN IN DEBUGGER! (Found m_pSurface uninitialized, maybe this?)
-	About/Shadows/About -> asserts
-	Add a program WM icon (make this part of GameRegistry)
-	Check if runs properly when in 16-bit display mode
-	Support multiple level sets
-	FindPath stuff gets very slow in big open spaces (which doesn't usually happen
	so maybe this isn't important?)
-	Improve keyboard "feel" (set a flag when key goes down etc, currently, using
	the actual keyboard repeat feels horrible)
-	Frame rate sucks
-	Font is ugly. Make a nice font. Make text at bottom larger; move to right.
-	Should save immediately when you've completed a level
-	LINUX: gcc: Sort out odd issue regarding order of initialization of
	globals, causing game registration to fail in g_GameRegistry
-	FUTURE: Scalable tile sets
-	FUTURE: Record and playback of solutions, using standard file formats
-	Returning from "about" with mouse click, click gets handled

DONE: MAIN
----------

-D	Generic game registry system

DONE: FRAMEWORK
---------------

-D	Saving and loading of settings isn't working

DONE: SOKOBAN
-------------

-D	If you redo a sokoban level in fewer moves the new num moves is not saved
-D	Remove background stuff
-D	It shouldn't let you make moves if you've already won
-D	Program is butt ugly. Need some decent sprites etc.
-D	Have some sort of 'you win' screen when you complete a level
-D	Allow variable sized spritesets (for larger/smaller levels etc)
